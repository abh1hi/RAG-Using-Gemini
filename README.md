# RAG Application for Constitution of India

This repository contains code for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application centered around the **Constitution of India**. The application allows users to retrieve relevant information from the constitution and generate responses using the power of language models.

## How to Try It Yourself

### Step 1: Open the Notebook
- Open the `RAG_GOOGLE_COLLAB_CODE.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18cV5bpfV_Eq9450ek5Ibnjx06L7yighR?usp=sharing

### Step 2: Prepare the Environment
- Add a `.env` file with the necessary API keys and configurations.
- Ensure that the file `20240716890312078.pdf` (Constitution of India) is in the same folder.

### Step 3: Run the Notebook
- Execute the cells in the notebook to run the RAG pipeline and interact with the Constitution of India data.

## Further Work

- **Streamlit Integration**: You can extend the application by integrating it with **Streamlit** for a chatbot experience.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Add functionality to retrieve additional data from **Wikipedia** for queries that are not covered in the Constitution of India.
